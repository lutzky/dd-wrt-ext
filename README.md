# DD-WRT Wifi monitor

This is a backup of an old chrome extension I had created back in 2013 (likely earlier). Its README:

> If you use DD-WRT's client-mode WiFi (that is, you use your router as a WiFi card), this extension will show you the current SSID and signal quality.
>
> You have to add the following line in your /etc/hosts (Linux) or C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file which looks like this:
>
> 192.168.2.1	dd-wrt
>
> Replace 192.168.2.1 with your actual router address. Alternatively, unpack the extension and replace every http://dd-wrt/ reference with the IP address of your router. This is required due to cross-site XHR request permissions.

I was only reminded this exists because of a "Requires Changes to Comply with Chrome Web Store Policy" email from the chrome web store; I figured it's worth backing up.
